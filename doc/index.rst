Welcome to wowp's documentation!
================================

wowp, or WOW:-P,  stands for a WOrkfloW framework in Python.

Our goal
--------

Wowp enables flow based programming in Python via actors and workflows. We prefer having a clean, straightforward API
for creating and connecting actors and workflows. The target coding style should be as simple as

.. code:: python

    # connect two actors
    actor2.inports['x'] += actor1.outports['y']
    # get the workflow
    workflow = actor2.get_workflow()
    # run the workflow
    workflow(x=1)

Source code
-----------

Wowp is an open-source project, licensed undet the MIT License. 
The source code is available from  `Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/urbanj/wowp>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.4+ (3.3 not tested, 2.7 is not supported at the moment)

Optional:

* Julia for Julia actors
* Matlab 2015a with Python Engine installed for Matlab actors
